# Phase 04 — Typed browser API client

**Dependency:** Phase 01  
**Handoff to:** Phases 06–10

## Goal

Provide a single safe typed transport boundary for the approved browser contract.

## Work boundary

- Implement API modules, request/response types, safe error normalization,
  request cancellation/loading conventions, and CSRF header/cookie support from
  Phase 00.
- Use contract fixtures/test server only; do not invent a production backend
  implementation in the UI.

## Acceptance criteria

- Components can consume typed modules without distributed fetch calls.
- Tests cover validation, authentication, challenge, rate-limit, network, and
  malformed-response behavior without exposing raw error text.
- Sensitive data is neither logged nor retained beyond the requested flow.

## Non-goals

Login UI, account screens, backend routes, or token storage.

## Handoff

Publish API module contract coverage and required backend fixture/schema version.
